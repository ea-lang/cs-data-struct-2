Recursion
1. Recursion is when a function calls itself in order to complete a task involving possible repetition
2. The base case is necessary because it is allows a condition for the recursive function to stop, else it would go on infinitely

Graphs
1. A tree that can contain loops (can be directed or non-directed)
2. A graph can have loops, while a tree cannot 
3. A network of friends

Sorting
1. Every pair in a list is compared; if the leftmost item is greater, they are swapped; 
the largest items bubble to the top eventually
2. The list is divided into sub-lists of one item; merge these smaller lists in an ordered fashion to create a sorted list
3. A 'pivot' is used initially; we compare numbers to the pivot and move them to the left or right of the pivot depending on whether they are larger than the pivot number.
